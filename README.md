Dark Theme Toggle Extension ☾


Description 🤓

This Chrome extension allows users to toggle a dark theme on and off for any website they visit. Designed to provide a more comfortable browsing experience, 
especially in low-light environments, this extension applies a dark background to web pages while ensuring that text remains readable and visually appealing.

Features 🔍:

Toggle Dark Theme: Easily switch between light and dark themes with a simple toggle button in the extension popup.

Persistent Theme Setting: The extension remembers your theme preference across browser sessions, so you don’t have to re-enable it every time you open Chrome.

Customizable Appearance: Uses CSS injection to apply a dark theme, ensuring that button backgrounds and other important elements retain their original colors for a consistent user experience.

How It Works ❓❓
